Ionic Country, Weather And News Reader

An ionic mobile application that reads news, weather and country data from internet resources. 
The application consists of a homepage and a settings page. The settings page allows a user to enter a city for which weather data will be displayed and to select the units in which weather data is presented. These settings can be saved. Once a city has been saved, weather and news for the city is shown in the homepage, if available.
